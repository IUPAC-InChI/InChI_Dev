### Atoms ordering/seniority



InChI orders atoms as follows:

*C, then other heavy atoms in lexicographical order, then bridging hydrogens*


NB: this means that *Zz and similar will sometimes be not the last*...

This may be *considered as modified Hill formula* which is [Wikipedia]: 
"The Hill system (or Hill notation) is a system of writing empirical chemical formulas, molecular chemical formulas and components of a condensed formula such that the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms next, and then the number of all other chemical elements subsequently, in alphabetical order of the chemical symbols. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. "
