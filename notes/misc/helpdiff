hg diff [OPTION]... ([-c REV] | [-r REV1 [-r REV2]]) [FILE]...

diff repository (or selected files)

    Show differences between revisions for the specified files.

    Differences between files are shown using the unified diff format.

    Note:
       diff may generate unexpected results for merges, as it will default to
       comparing against the working directory's first parent changeset if no
       revisions are specified.

    When two revision arguments are given, then changes are shown between
    those revisions. If only one revision is specified then that revision is
    compared to the working directory, and, when no revisions are specified,
    the working directory files are compared to its parent.

    Alternatively you can specify -c/--change with a revision to see the
    changes in that changeset relative to its first parent.

    Without the -a/--text option, diff will avoid generating diffs of files it
    detects as binary. With -a, diff will generate a diff anyway, probably
    with undesirable results.

    Use the -g/--git option to generate diffs in the git extended diff format.
    For more information, read "hg help diffs".

    Examples:

    - compare a file in the current working directory to its parent:

        hg diff foo.c

    - compare two historical versions of a directory, with rename info:

        hg diff --git -r 1.0:1.2 lib/

    - get change stats relative to the last change on some date:

        hg diff --stat -r "date('may 2')"

    - diff all newly-added files that contain a keyword:

        hg diff "set:added() and grep(GNU)"

    - compare a revision and its parents:

        hg diff -c 9353         # compare against first parent
        hg diff -r 9353^:9353   # same using revset syntax
        hg diff -r 9353^2:9353  # compare against the second parent

    Returns 0 on success.

 -B --ignore-blank-lines  ignore changes whose lines are all blank
 -U --unified NUM         number of lines of context to show
