#### 1.2. Who is responsible for InChI? 

InChI is a project of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) described at: http://www.iupac.org/inchi/ 

The IUPAC body which takes care of the current and future shape of InChI is  the "IUPAC InChI Subcommittee" (IUPAC Division VIII InChI Subcommittee).  

Current members of the IUPAC InChI Subcommittee are:

- *Chair:* S. R. Heller
- *Secretary:* A. D. McNaught 
- *Members*: S. M. Bachrach, C. Batchelor, E. Bolton, N.      Goncharoff, J. M. Goodman, M. Nicklaus, I. Pletnev, H. Rey, S. E. Stein,      C. Steinbeck, K. T. Taylor, D. Tchekhovskoi, E. S. Wilks, A. Williams, A.      Yerin. 

There exist also InChI Subcommittee working groups made up of additional chemists who are developing rules for extending the capabilities of InChI. See: http://iupac.org/web/ins/802

Historically, the primary development of the InChI algorithm and software took place at NIST (US National Institute of Standards and Technology,  USA) under the auspices of IUPAC. 

Since 2009, the responsibility for InChI technical development and promotion has been in the hands of the InChI Trust - a not-for-profit organization which works in close contact with IUPAC (and of which IUPAC is a member). 

The lists of InChI Trust members, associates, and supporters are updated frequently, the current lists can be found at:
