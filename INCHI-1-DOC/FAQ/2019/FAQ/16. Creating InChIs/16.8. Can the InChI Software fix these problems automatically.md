### 16.8. Can the InChI Software fix these problems automatically? 

Not really for hydrogen atoms. Though InChI Software may add hydrogen atoms, this can go wrong in difficult cases so a safer way would be that you do “hydrogenation before InChIfication” (subjected to quality control) and then generate InChI with the DoNotAddH switch.

The InChI Software will flag unknown stereocentres. It may then be possible to search this InChI against other InChIs where the stereocentres are known and perhaps to add the missing information by hand.
